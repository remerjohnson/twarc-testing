# Testing Twarc

This repo is the result of working with [twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc). I tested it using it as a Python library (test.py), and also created a jupyer (iPython) notebook that uses `jq` to work with a large amount of Twitter JSON data.  

In the future I hope to further use some visualization tools on the data.
